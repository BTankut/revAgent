## Source vs Install Payload

`src/revit-plugin` is source code. It is where Revit add-in development happens.
The main add-in host is `src/revit-plugin/revit-mcp-plugin`. Transactionless
UI view tools are implemented as the separate
`src/revit-plugin/RevitMCPViewCommandSet` project so the dynamic
`send_code_to_revit` command payload stays isolated. `SampleCommandSet` is
legacy sample source and is not part of the deployed production command set.

`installer/revit-plugin` is install payload. Production installers copy from this
folder into `C:\ProgramData\DPE\RevitMCP`. Do not edit the binary payload by
hand. Build the source and refresh the payload binaries with:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\build-revit-plugin.ps1 -RevitVersion 2022
```

Then commit both the source change and the refreshed payload binaries.

`installer/runtime-mcp-server/src` and `installer/revit-api-docs-mcp/src` are
the TypeScript MCP source trees. Their `build/` folders remain the runtime
payload contract consumed by installer and Codex MCP registrations.

`installer/lib` contains shared PowerShell helper modules for updater/installer
behavior. `config/revit-versions.json` is the central Revit version matrix.

## Release Rule

Production releases happen from `main` only.

Feature/experiment branches that exist on GitHub are historical and should not
be used for office deployment. NAS deployment reads only packages published from
this repository's `main` branch. Modernization or test branches may be used for
local build/smoke work, but must not run `publish-nas-release.ps1` or update the
stable NAS channel.

For the full developer and code-assistant workflow, including clone recovery,
local testing, commit/push, NAS stable publishing, updater diagnostics, and
Revit-close policy, read `docs/DEVELOPER_RUNBOOK.md`.

## Deployment

NAS releases are still produced with:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\installer\nas\publish-nas-release.ps1 `
  -ReleaseRoot "\\dpe-nas\Dpe-Ortak\Baris Tankut\revit-mcp-deploy" `
  -Channel stable
```

The generated release ZIP remains self-contained for office workstations. During
packaging, `publish-nas-release.ps1` also adds a legacy `kurulum/` alias inside
the ZIP so older workstation updaters can install the renamed layout safely.
